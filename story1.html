						<h1>Alex<br />
						Solomon</h1>
						<p>Seven-month old Alex Solomon from Baringo County, Kenya, was born with Hydrocephalus at Marigat District Hospital as the fourth child to Purity Jelimo. Purity is a stay at home mom taking care of her four children who are all dependent on their dad who is a pastoralist.</p>

					<div class="image main"><img src="images/1.png" alt="" /></div>
					<p>
						Purity was sent home after giving birth to Alex without any assistance or treatment, she was asked to look for assistance elsewhere.  All this is because Marigat District Hospital lacked the required expertise to cater for Alex’s condition.After visiting a number of hospitals with no help, she came to know about Bethany Kids Kijabe while in her search for Alex’s treatment.   It became a challenge to reach Bethany Kids because of the long distance, finance to facilitate their traveling costs as well as safety due to bandits. Purity had to beg for money from family and friends. Finally she was able to travel to Bethany Kids Kijabe hospital.

						Alex’s surgery was done and a shunt was placed to relieve the fluid inside the brain. Thankfully it was successful, the doctor recommended a two week post-op review. To Purity this meant going to Baringo and coming back in time for the review at BK. This is a great  challenge because from the beginning this family has financial constraints back home.
					</p>
					<p>
						For continuity of care the doctor needs Alex to be stable before he is  fully discharged to go home. This is when the House of Hope program in Nairobi came in handy. Alex and the mom were accommodated at House of Hope Nairobi for two weeks, at the House of Hope they received free accommodation and meals for the two weeks. Purity also received psychosocial support , training on Hydrocephalus  and got the chance to meet and interact with other parents like her which gave her a lot of hope.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Support is needed to do regular follow ups on Alex’s progress to achieve life-long care. His mum needs psychosocial support and ongoing  training on how to cope up with the condition and give Alex long life and a bright future. Being part of the BK outreach and the parents association provides even much more hope to Alex and his mum as they know they are not alone.
